Abstract:
The paper presents a criteria, called coefficients stability, for inaccuracy in determining
the coefficients of non-linear regression models describing inexact data. A method for
coefficients stability estimation is also described. The proposed criteria is illustrated
by a computational experiment with the data obtained in measurements of refractive index
dependence on wavelengh in 400-1000 nm band for transparent polymer. The convergence of
proposed criteria to the known analytical solution for the case of linear regression is also
studied.
